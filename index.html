								<h5>Game Design, Documentation, Horizon Worlds, Systems Design, Mobile, UI Design</h5>
								<p>The goal for this project was to deliver to the public creators a world with UI assets built using the native Custom UI. As the sole designer I focused on identifying bite sized UI's that be plugged into the average Horizon Worlds expirience. This meant figuring out what the HW user base needed and figure out to supply that in confined asset. Alongside this, I also focused on how to customize these, identifying the parts that need to be flexible versus rigid.</p>

								<p>This simulator set in Horizon Worlds was built as a request to deliver a refrence world for an incremental simulation game. A world whos purpose it is to be a jumping off point for the average creator to build and incremental simulator off of. As such it had its own design challenges. As the sole designer I set about tackling this by focusing on what the core game required: currency acquision, means of spending currency, and enhancing ones ability to gain more currency. Additionally a focus on documentation for the public resulted in a large amount of writing for the public and code commenting.</p>

								<h2>Bot Bash</h2>
								<h3>Mercenary Technology</h3>
								<h4>Jan 2025 - Apr 2025</h4>
								<h5>Game Design, Documentation, Horizon Worlds, Balance, Systems Design, Mobile, UI Design</h5>
								<p>After Robot Raiders conclusion we set out to build a mobile game in Meta Horizon worlds on a very short deadline and a much smaller team. As the sole designer, I focused on defining the gameplay systems and UI flow for the game, utlizing as many assets as we could from the previous project. Aiming for simplicity, we created a autobattler built using the previous games enemy robots as the units for the game. each bot had a rock paper scissors type interaction so swapping the teams out was crutial. Additionally, levelling up bots would give them the ability to potentially overpower thier weakness resulting in a interesting balancing act.</p>
								<p>While this project was fast and small, it was my first expirience as a solo designer. The baseline had been set: Autobattle gameplay, using as much art and code from the previous project Robot Raiders (see below). Taking what I had learned about scope in mind I tried to keep the scope small and agile while balancing giving players meaningful choice. Much time was spent balancing where player choice was most impactful while trying to not create off shoot gameloops. What resulted was a very simple yet polished game for the time we had.</p>

								<h2>Robot Raiders</h2>
								<h3>Mercenary Technology</h3>
								<h4>Feb 2023 - Jan 2025</h4>
								<h5>Game Design, Documentation, Horizon Worlds, Prototyping, Balance, Systems Design, VR, UI Design</h5>
								<p>Robot Raider's is a Multiplayer VR First person shooter roguelite built in Meta's Horizon worlds. This was my first professional design project. As a designer on this project I planned and prototyped gameplay systems, such as gun play, active reloading and more. As the project, progressed I put more focus on procedural systems. As the projects scope started to get out of hand scaling back to use the various knobs created to tune a variety of different weapons. Whilest handling design duties I also spearheaded the UI side of things for the game, first creating a system using objects and eventually adopting a brand new native UI framework. By the end of the project I was handling tuning stats for players, enemies, and ~20 different weapons.</p>
								<p>As my first profressional project, this epxirience taught me much about the game making process. Documentation was a massive part of this project. As such I became adept at using confluence and was constantly improving my doc writing skills well after this project ended. Another major hurdle I learned about with this project was scope.In the beginning, I feel into the trap of tons of content and ended up needing to cut back and cut off many of the ideas that had been planned. This expirience taught me is how to more accurately judge scope and to design with creatablity in mind.</p>

								<h2>Archæan Study</h2>
								<h3>Made for CMPM 172 - Game Design III</h3>
							  <h4>April-June 2022</h4>
							  <h5>Game Design, Game Research, Creature Design, Game Modding, Game Theory</h5>
							  <p>As my last solo project for College, I wanted to try my hand at designing a creature for Rainbow Six Extraction. Going into this project I knew I only had a few weeks and wanted to make a creature that had unique gameplay mechanics compared to creatures already in the game. To begin I started by doing research I learned the abilities and mechanics of all the creatures in the game so far and compiled them into a set of slides. After doing this I started to compare the composition of units to other games such as the zerg from Starcraft, and the holy trinity of rpgs. After doing this I determined that the Archæan line up was missing a flying unit and a healing unit. So going to the designing portion I started with playing with verticality. I began with the concpet of flight and after brainstorming it into many different scenarios I determined flight in open air would be too free, while flight in a corridor would be too restricting. So to account the map design yet still playing with vertciallity I looked at the nests and how they are attached to the walls. With this I desided to have this new Archæan be able to climb walls. Next I focused on the gameplay. With the concept of a healer I looked to the Doc, a playable character and his ability to heal. To do so he fires a stim pistol at an ally healing them. Taking this mechanic I could then justify the verticallity as well as this would allow this "healer unit" to hit units in the front lines while it can sit in the back. being high up also allows the player to focus it with the risk of being swarmed from the ground. After this I came up with some concept art and made some small tweaks along the way.</p>

								<h2>50 Card Game Design Challenge</h2>
								<h3>Made for CMPM 172 - Game Design III</h3>
							  <h4>April 2022</h4>
							  <h5>Game Design, Card Game, Systems Design, Play Testing, Corridator</h5>
							  <p>Over the course of 3 weeks, I researched an old game called Clash of Dragons, and created a set of 50 card for the game. For this task my first step was researching this old game. Being the game had died and there is almost no video gameplay footage, I had to resort partially to my memory of the game, and more so the wiki which still exists. Through this I researched the game mechanics and card concepts. once I had laid out a set of guides for myself, I started by making some basic card concepts to playtest with to make sure I hadn't missed the mark. After that I looked for inspiration and after some time, I came up with character thematics. Each class in the game had some theming, so I decided to lean into that and create cards based around a theme of each class. beyond that I tried to relate these themes to in game mechanics. For example, a druid deck might involve lots of summoning of creatures and so the NPC card type which tends to involve bringing in outside characters stood out. After designing 45+ cards and playtesting a few iterations, I put my pencil down and moved on to another project. This project had taught me much about linking creative processes to game mechanics.</p>

								<h2>Fragments of You</h2>
								<h3>Made for CMPM 171 - Game Design II</h3>
							  <h4>January-March 2022</h4>
							  <h5>Game Design, C#, Unity, Movement Design, Object Design, Level Design, 12 Person Team, In Engine Cutscenes</h5>
							  <p>Fragments of You is a Unity based 2d platformer where the main character loses their own limbs and abilities, in an attempt to combine the parts of their partner. This game was worked on by a group of 12, with general roles for everyone. In this project I took on a general programmer role, an in-engine cutscene designer, and later on a design adviser role. In the beginning, I focused on programming the core movement mechanics. This included left right movement, jumping and eventually wall jumping. These mechanics went through multiple iterations starting with unity physics, and eventually ending on using Unity physics as a base from more complicated physics on top of Unity’s physics resulting in a refined, snappy movement system. Beyond movement I also worked on a couple of the interactable objects in the game. The box, button, and door where all objects that I created as prefabs for the level designers to play in the levels. The boxes need to be pushed on to moving platforms and thus required complicated collision detection to determine parent and unparent boxes stacked on top of moving platforms. Buttons and doors go hand in hand as to create these I made a set of parent classes, for which the button, door, and in the future other objects could be built from. Once the parent classes where linked one could inherit a child class and have it communicated with the buttons and doors with no extra code beyond features. As for the in engine cutscenes, these were made using Unity’s timeline manager. I used my prior experience in animation to learn and animate these cutscenes using the actually game objects being used in game. Additionally, I worked as a design adviser when nearing the end of allotted time. During this process the level designers, playtest organizer and myself, would get together and go through each part of a level a tweak them to make for a better experience. In this case I focused on what the level designer was intending to have the player to do and why the player was or was not performing in that way. After this, we would modify the levels with the goal of keeping the level designers intended interaction, while assisting the player in either difficulty or direction on what the intended design was. As of 3/24/2022 I finished work on this project to pursue other interests.</p>

								<h2>Player Influenced Dungeon Level Generator</h2>
								<h3>Made for CMPM 146 - Game AI</h3>
							  <h4>Febuary-March 2022</h4>
							  <h5>Game Design, AI, Level Generation, Player Influenced Design, C#, Unity, Python, 4 Person Team</h5>
							  <p>The goal of this project was to make more than a generic level generator. We strove to make a generator, that would tailor levels towards player performance. As a result, levels would be made easier and harder based on not only the player’s health and upgrades but also their play style. To do this we added trackers to the player and enemies. This recorded all kinds of data about the player involving how much of the level do they explore before leaving, or how many enemies they killed versus how many spawned, or simply how much time was spent on the given level. Once we found all this information, we needed to translate this data to what that meant for level design. In this case having a very simple game that we based this off of helped to minimize the potential complexity of what the data could represent. An example would be the player was only able to attack left or right, but able to move in up and down as well. Thus, narrow vertical corridors, were very dangerous to the player as enemies where simply based on collision. Thus, in finding the player completing the level healthy and killing all the enemies, the generator would prioritize levels with more vertical corridor generations. This was a fun project to work on as I haven’t seen this style of level generation in most commercial game to date.</p>

								<h2>Crisp-Game-Lib Games</h2>
								<h3>Made for CMPM 170 - Game Design Studio</h3>
							  <h4>2021</h4>
							  <h5>Game Design, 1 Week Design, Javascript, 1 Button Games</h5>
								<p>These games were made using Kenta Cho's <a href="https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib">crsip-game-lib</a>. In this project, I learned how to use a game library to develop 3 games over the course of 2 weeks. The first game I created is called Swoop, in which the player is a bird flying in a circle trying to catch fish that jump in the center of the circle. I developed this game solo and it served as my main testing ground for learning the library. In the second game, I worked with a partner to create ItemDrop, which was finished in just one hour. My partner and I worked very well as a team to write the code over a discord call.  The last game created was IdleCats and I was responsible for the main code structure for this game and the version control setup. I functioned as the lead for a team of 7 and focused on setting goals for the team to work towards. This involved brainstorming game ideas with everyone as well as helping determine gameplay features and how they could be implemented within the library.</p>

								<h2>Alien Soccer</h2>
								<h3>Made for CMPM 120 - Game Development Experience</h3>
							  <h4>2021</h4>
							  <h5>Game Design, C#, Unity</h5>
							  <p>The goal of Alien soccer was to create an infinite runner game. The final product was a game where the aliens sacrificed themselves to try and kick their precious ball away from a blackhole. In the project, I developed the physics and main gameplay of the ball mechanics such as kicking, collisions, and attachment to the aliens. Additionally, I developed the mechanics of falling into the blackhole in the center. Though this project was completed in a group, I led the team. I learned a lot about hosting a GitHub repository for multiple people through this assignment.</p>
