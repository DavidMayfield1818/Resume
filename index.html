								<h2>Alien Soccer</h2>
								<h3>Made for CMPM 120</h3>
							  <h4>2021</h4>
							  <p>&nbsp;Alien soccer was a project for my class where the goal was to make an infinite runner. The out come was a game where alien would sacrifice themselves to try and kick their precious ball away from a blackhole. In the project I worked on the physics and main gameplay mechanics of kicking, and having the ball collide and attach to the players. Additionally the&nbsp; blackhole details of falling ito the center was developed by me. All in all this project was done in a group, with me as the lead. I learned alot about hosting a github repository for multiple people through this assignment.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

								<h2>Crisp-Game-Lib Games</h2>
								<h3>Made for CMPM 170</h3>
							  <h4>2021</h4>
								<p>These games were made using Kenta Cho's <a href="https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib">crsip-game-lib</a>. In this prject I learn how to use a brand new libaray to make 3 games all over the course of 2 weeks. I developed 3 games during this tim . The first is a game called Swoop, when the player is a bird flying in a circle trying to catch fish that jump up in the middle. This game I developed solo and was my main testing ground for learning the library. Then I got with a partner and created ItemDrop in an hour over a discord call. This game was a prime example of teamwork as start to finsih we were ina discord call, working on the same code. The last game was call IdleCats, and as far as coding goes, I set up the main structure for the game. This project was worked on by 7 people with me as the lead. In the leadership position, I focused on getting the team a goal to work towards. This involved getting game ideas from everyone as well as helping determine gameplay features and how they could be implented within the library.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

						    <h2>Battleship</h2>
								<h3>Made for online summer C++ course</h3>
								<h4>2019</h4>
							  <p>This program demonstrated my ability to make games in C++. this game was just a game of battleship ported to a PC via me. In this project I created everything from the ground up. It invloved creating classes, inhertance, states and more to make a working game. A second part of this project was creating an AI opponent. For this I implemented a heuristc of the board, and had the AI act on what the best move acourding to the hueristic.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

								<h2>Home Depot</h2>
								<h3></h3>
								<h4>2021</h4>
								<p>I worked at Home Depot for a while during my 3rd year during the quarentine. I was an electrical assossiate, meaning that it was my job to help people find anthying in the electric department. This included everything from lighting, to wiring, to conduit, to switches and outlets. I was tasked with helping&nbsp; and informing people on the proper approaches to electrical tasks.&nbsp; This job required alot of teamwork, and really taught me how to ask for help on things. This included knowledge of store policies, where product is and so on. By the end of my time there I knew most of my fellow assossiates as I had asked many a question to them.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

								<h2>Risk of Rain 2 100%</h2>
								<h4>2019-2021</h4>
								<p>I have played 250 hours of Risk of Rain 2, and 100% the game. Through trying to accomplish this I learned how the game worked on a deep level and how each item stacks in different ways. I learned how maps were designed, secrets on levels, and how every character works. I am proud to say if you look at my profile it shows 100% completion.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
